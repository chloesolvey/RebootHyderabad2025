404dnf_REPO
Overview
REBOOT_REPO is a robust analytics and automation toolkit for Google BigQuery environments. It is designed to automate SQL query analysis, cost and sustainability monitoring, forecasting, and operational insights—all seamlessly integrated with reporting in Looker Studio.

Features
Automated SQL Analysis

Monitors the sql/ directory for all query files.

Executes static analysis, dry runs, and validation on each file.

Estimates query cost, bytes processed, and associated CO₂ emissions.

Produces optimization recommendations.

Aggregated Results & Forecasting

Loads query findings and recommendations into centralized BigQuery tables.

Triggers ML forecasting models (in ml_models/) for cost, data usage, and carbon impact.

BigQuery Operational Monitoring

Uses a Log Router to ingest BigQuery logs.

Generates usage metrics, anomaly detection, and operational insights.

End-to-End Reporting

All cost, usage, and sustainability KPIs are available via Looker Studio dashboards.

Deployment: CI/CD via Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Run Job
Automated Deployment Workflow
A Cloud Build Trigger is configured to watch the sql/ directory in the repository.

On any change inside sql/, the following sequence is automatically executed:

Docker Image Build

The project’s application is packaged using the included Dockerfile.

Push to Google Artifact Registry

The new Docker image is pushed to your designated Artifact Registry.

Cloud Run Job Creation and Execution

A Cloud Run job is created or updated with the latest image.

The job is then automatically executed, processing any new queries and updating results.

Setup Instructions
1. Cloud Build Trigger
In the Google Cloud Console:

Create a new Cloud Build trigger.

Connect your repository.

Trigger type: Push to a branch

Include Files: sql/**

Configuration file: cloudbuild.yaml in the repo root.

2. cloudbuild.yaml Example
text
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['build', '-t', 'REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPO_NAME/image-name:$COMMIT_SHA', '.']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['push', 'REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPO_NAME/image-name:$COMMIT_SHA']
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    entrypoint: 'gcloud'
    args:
      [
        'run', 'jobs', 'deploy', 'bq-analysis-job',
        '--image', 'REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPO_NAME/image-name:$COMMIT_SHA',
        '--region', 'YOUR_REGION',
        '--project', '$PROJECT_ID'
      ]
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    entrypoint: 'gcloud'
    args:
      [
        'run', 'jobs', 'execute', 'bq-analysis-job',
        '--region', 'YOUR_REGION',
        '--project', '$PROJECT_ID'
      ]

options:
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
Update REGION, PROJECT_ID, REPO_NAME, and YOUR_REGION to match your environment.

This ensures the Cloud Run job is always up-to-date with your latest analysis logic.

3. Artifact Registry Setup
Create an Artifact Registry repository for your Docker images.

Ensure the Cloud Build service account has push permissions.

4. Cloud Run Job
A Cloud Run job (e.g., bq-analysis-job) is created if not existing, or updated on every build.

The job executes entrypoint logic (typically in src/main.py) for orchestrating the full workload.

Usage
Local Development & Testing
Install Python3 Dependencies:

bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Run Main Pipeline Locally:

bash
python3 -m src.main
Production & Automation
Push changes to the sql/ directory (or merge a PR)—Cloud Build automates the rest, including deployment and execution.

Data & Reporting Flow
Raw SQL analysis, recommendations, and forecast results are stored in BigQuery.

BigQuery usage logs, cost metrics, and sustainability analytics are processed and loaded for in-depth dashboards.

Looker Studio consumes these tables, providing business and engineering teams with actionable insights.

Key Modules
Path	Role
alerts/alerting_logic.py	BigQuery usage monitoring / alerting
src/main.py	Orchestrates analysis pipeline and workload
sql/	SQL query files—trigger workflow and are analyzed
src/recommendation/analysis_utils.py	Main logic for query checks and recommendations
ml_models/	Forecasting models (future cost, usage, sustainability)
Extending the Project
Add new analytics or forecasting models in ml_models/.

Customize monitoring or alerting logic in alerts/alerting_logic.py.

Expand static and dynamic checks in src/recommendation/analysis_utils.py.

Contributing
Fork the repository and create feature branches for any enhancements.

Write tests in src/tests/.

Open pull requests with clear descriptions and test coverage.
