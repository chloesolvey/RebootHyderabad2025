To run your project locally using npm, follow these steps:

1. Initialize npm (if not already done)
Open a terminal in your project folder and run:
npm init -y

2. Install a Static Server
Install a simple static server, such as serve:
npm install -g serve
or as a dev dependency:
npm install --save-dev serve
3. Serve Your public Folder
Run this command from your project root:
npx serve public
or, if installed globally:
serve public
4. Open in Browser
The terminal will show a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000). Open this in your browser to view your app.

Note:
If you want to remove Firebase, make sure to also remove all Firebase imports and related code from your main.js as previously discussed.
If you use ES modules and import/export, serving over HTTP (not ) is required, which serve provides.
